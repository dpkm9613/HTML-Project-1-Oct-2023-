<h1> Best animes according to ME</h1>
<h2> Top 3 animes based on personal preference!! </h2>
<hr />
    <h3> 1. Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann </h3>
    <P> Hot blooded shounen action which teaches morals. My fav.</P1>

    <h3> 2. D.Gray Man </h3>
    <p> Dark action that had a lot of potential to continue but didn't. Maybe I should read the manga soon. </p>

    <h3> 3. Ikkitousen </h3>
    <p> We all know why. </p>
